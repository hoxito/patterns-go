# Facade Pattern


## Description
Facade provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. 
Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

## Motivation
When a package has multiple interfaces, it can get difficult for clients to use it.
Structuring a system into subsystems helps reduce complexity. A common design goal is to minimize the communication and dependencies between subsystems.
One way to achieve this goal is to introduce a facade object that provides a single, simplified interface to the more general facilities of a subsystem

## Code Example

In the example given, we define 2 models: 
A character, that will use a potion 
A potion that will be used.
