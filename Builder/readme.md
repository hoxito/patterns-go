# Builder Pattern

Sometimes, object creation is not so straightforward. For example:
It might be necessary to have business rules to validate some parameters or
derive some added attributes.

We might need some code to bring in efficiencyâ€”for example, retrieving
an object from the cache rather than reading from the DB.

It might be necessary to have idempotency and thread safety in object
creation. That is, multiple requests for object creation with the same
parameters should give the same object.

The objects might have multiple constructor arguments (typically called
telescopic constructors), and it is difficult to remember the order of
parameters for the clients. Some of these parameters might be optional.
Such constructors frequently lead to bugs in client code.
